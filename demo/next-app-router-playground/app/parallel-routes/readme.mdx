# Parallel Routes

- Parallel Routes allow you to simultaneously or conditionally render
  multiple pages, with independent navigation, in the same layout.
- Parallel Routes can be used for advanced routing patterns like [Conditional Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#conditional-routes) and [Intercepted Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes).
- Try using the tabs in one parallel route to navigate. Notice the URL
  changes but the unaffected parallel route is preserved.
- Try using the browser's backwards and forwards navigation.
  Notice the browser's URL history state and active UI state is
  correctly synced.
- Try navigating to a tab in one parallel route and refreshing the
  browser. Notice you can choose what UI to show parallel routes that
  don't match the initial URL.
