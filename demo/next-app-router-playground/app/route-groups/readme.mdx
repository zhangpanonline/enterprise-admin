# Route Groups

Route groups can be used to:

- Opt a route segment out of a shared layout.
- Organize routes without affecting the URL structure.
- Create multiple root layouts by partitioning the top level of the
  application.

### Demo

- This example uses Route Groups to create layouts for different sections of an app.
  - (main): primary shared UI
    - (shop): ecommerce specific shared UI
    - (marketing): marketing specific shared UI
  - (checkout): top level group that opts out of primary shared UI
- Try navigating pages and noting the different layouts used for each
  section.
