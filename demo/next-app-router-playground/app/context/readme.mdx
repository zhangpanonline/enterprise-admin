# Client Context

Importing a component into a file marked with `'use client'` makes it part of the client bundle. This means you can't import Server Components into Client Components.

However, you can pass a Server Component as a prop (or child) to a Client Component. This lets you visually nest Server Components inside client-rendered UI.

With this pattern, you can place a client context provider high in the tree and still nest Server Components inside it. Client Components deeper down can access the shared contextâ€”even if a Server Component sits between them.

### Demo

- **Shared State**: Try incrementing the counter and navigating between categories.
